When the prompts appear, type in your initials, desired text color, and desired logo color and press the enter key. To select a shape, use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through the choices and press the enter key when your desired shape choice is highlighted. Once you have responded to all of the prompts, a confirmation message will be logged to the terminal and your new logo.svg will appear in your directory.
